# AtomicQueue
C++ Queue that is hope-fully-concurrent by use of atomics. This queue is based on an array instead of a linked list

All of the concurrent queues that I have found through google are based on a linked-list or use mutexes.
I would like to learn proper use of atomics and I decided this would be a good project with which to learn them.
